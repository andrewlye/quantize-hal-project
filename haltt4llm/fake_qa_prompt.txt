Generate plausible, but trick trivia questions. They should span a broad
range of categories. Each question should contain an entirely made up on
the spot noun that is not a product of human creativiy or naming. The questions
should be about non-fictional persons, places and things, but include one
or more made up or fictional nouns. At least one made up or fictional noun
must be in the question itself not in the answers. The questions should
be complex and detailed. The correct answer for all these questions should
be 'I don't know'.

Here are two examples of such questions:
